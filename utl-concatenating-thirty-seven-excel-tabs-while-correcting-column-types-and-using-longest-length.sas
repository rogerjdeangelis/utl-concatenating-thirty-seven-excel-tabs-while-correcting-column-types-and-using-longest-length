I was given a workbook with 37 tabs and I needed to concatenate all 37.                                                                 
There is a common set of columns in all 37 tabs, however some columns were                                                              
numeric in one tab and character in another.                                                                                            
both numeric and charater.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
I dont use 'proc import' for obvious reasons.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                        
First you need to set guessing rows to the max 32756 by changing a registry setting.

4. How to add row numbers which determine one variableâ€™s type                                                                           
TypeGuessRows                                                                                                                           
In SAS excel engine, we need to change the windows registry settings, the locations are not same in each windows                        
or MS office version.                                                                                                                   
For windows7 x64 with MS office 2013 64-bit, it is in                                                                                   
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE / Software / Microsoft /Office/15.0 /AccessConnectivityEngine /Engines/ Excel                                        
Change the value of TypeGuessRows to 0, which by default, is 8 in hexadecimal.                                                          
Then all the rows will be scanned and checked.                                                                                          
But we should know that changes also affect other software that uses the Microsoft Jet provider to access Excel file                    
data, including accessing Excel data in a Microsoft Access database.                                                                    
                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                        
Here is the solution
